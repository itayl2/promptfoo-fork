I want a creative strategist in-depth analysis and classification for the provided social media ads creative. Support your analysis by looking at the creative insights, metrics and performance summary.

Identify and classify the creative elements that matter in an advertising creative. Include all the elements listed below, and add anything else that you can be relevant. If an element of this list is not relevant or applicable for a given creative, just state so by making it empty array or null element

- Format:
   - Statics**:** Describe the format of static imagery
   - Videos, Carousels, GIFs**:** Specify if these are included or not
- Messaging
   - User Journey: Describe the target stage(s) of the user journey and key elements of the messaging
   - Desire Messaging: Highlight the messaging focus areas (e.g., inclusivity, simplicity) and note any absent themes (e.g., romance, power, family, intelligence).
   - Strategic Messaging: Highlight the messaging focus areas (e.g., inclusivity, simplicity) and note any absent themes (e.g., romance, power, family, intelligence).
   - Numbers: Note the inclusion of statistics, social proof, or numerical claims
- Imagery
   - Hacks: Describe visual techniques used, such as lighting, design, or visual motifs like grids
   - Setting: Describe the setting (e.g., neutral, specific background, etc.)
   - Editing: Detail design choices, such as fonts, pacing, and overall aesthetic
   - Production: Comment on the production quality, including image quality, lighting, and texture presentation
- Talent
   - Creator / Influencer: Specify if creators or influencers are featured
   - Demographics (Race, Age, Gender): Discuss representation and inclusivity
   - Celebrity: State if celebrities are involved in the ad
   - AI / Animations: Note if AI elements or animations are included

Remember to:

- Support and elaborate on your findings using evidence from creative insights, metrics, performance summary and your own expert knowledge as creative strategist
- Focus on:- Where the eye goes- What has more screen time- What is repeated- Trigger words in the creative that are repeated- Messaging / human desires
