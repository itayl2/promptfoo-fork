I want to an analysis of the social media ads creatives reports that are codenamed kilo and lima. I want to know what are the next steps for each creative:

- Is there something to improve? elaborate regardless if yes or no
- Is there something to scale? elaborate regardless if yes or no
- Is there something to test? elaborate regardless if yes or no
- Maybe it's best to totally pivot, and do something else all together?
- Any relevant suggestions?
- Suggestions to trigger other creative strategist missions as follow-up?

Be careful to:

- Return your next steps report in json format. The json should be an array, containing a json object for each analyzed creatives
- To reference a creative, use the slug rather than the id.
- The json objects of the array should comply to the provided zod schema

For context, this is the zod schema to comply to:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

/**
 * Schema for validating next steps report for each creative.
 */
export const CreativeNextStepsSchema = z.object({
  slug: z
    .string()
    .describe("The reference slug for the creative, e.g., 'alpha', 'beta'."),
  improvements: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "List of suggestions or insights on what to improve for this creative."
    ),
  scale: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "List of recommendations on how or whether to scale the creative."
    ),
  test: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "List of testing ideas or experiments to run for further optimization."
    ),
  pivot: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "List of reasons/ways to pivot if incremental improvements don't work."
    ),
  relevantSuggestions: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "Additional relevant suggestions or best practices for the creative."
    ),
  followUpMissions: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe(
      "Potential follow-up missions or campaigns that a creative strategist might deploy next."
    ),
});
```

For context, this is the creative summary:
{{ mainSummary }}

For context, this is the creative performance summary:
{{ STORED_OUTPUT_MAIN_performanceStatsSummary }}

For context, this is the creative classification:
{{ STORED_OUTPUT_MAIN_creativeChecklist }}

For context, this is the creative report:
{{ creativeReport }}
